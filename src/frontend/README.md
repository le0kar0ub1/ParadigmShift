# Frontend documentation

As explained in the design documentation, we are actually using an `Amazon S3` to host static website.

The front is actually simple so far and composed only of hand made *HTML/CSS*.

## User access flow

## Page Description

Got three pages to handle the necessary.

### Root Page

This page is basicaly the entry point of the website.

All the registered applications are displayed.

You can then target a particular one to apply modification.

This page is dedicated to the registering of an application.
